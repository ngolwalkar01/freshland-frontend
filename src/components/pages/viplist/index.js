                <p>
                  Sun-ripened oranges üçä clementines, grapefruits and other
                  citrus fruits üçã fresh from the tree, are simply the best. It
                  was citrus fruits, more specifically oranges, that marked the
                  beginning of Fresh.Land when, a few years ago, we helped
                  Arthur sell his delicious oranges.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today Arthur has retired, but fortunately we have many other
                  passionate farmers around Spain and Portugal whose products we
                  can enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The citrus fruits will be available both in individual boxes
                  and in some of our mixed boxes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We expect the citrus season to start around October or
                  November, but of course it depends on the weather.
