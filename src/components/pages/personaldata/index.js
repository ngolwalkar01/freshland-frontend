        <h4>About the information</h4>
        <p>Information to the data subject regarding the handling of personal data.</p>
        <p>This document describes how Fresh.Land IVS, Cvr no. 36481897 – (hereinafter &ldquo;Fresh.Land IVS&ldquo;, &ldquo;us&ldquo;, &ldquo;our&ldquo;, &ldquo;we&ldquo;) collects and processes personal data about you as a natural person.</p>
        <p>Fresh.Land IVS is the data controller for your personal data. All inquiries regarding our processing of your personal data can be made to us via the contact details specified under point 7.</p>
        <h4>How we collect personal data</h4>

Furthermore, when you visit our website, we also automatically collect other data, for example which browser you use, which search terms you use, which website pages you visit, your IP address including your network location, as well as information about your computer and telephone or other technological tools you use.</p>

        <h4>The purpose</h4>
        <p>The purpose of processing your personal data is so that we can deliver the products you have ordered, answer questions and in other respects be able to fulfill our agreement with you. Information regarding your purchases may also be processed in order for us to comply with statutory requirements, including requirements relating to bookkeeping and accounts and to prevent fraud as far as possible. Processing also aims to optimize the user experience and to carry out targeted marketing, including retargeting marketing via Facebook and Google. This processing of personal data is necessary for us to satisfy our interest in providing you with the best possible service and to show you relevant content and relevant offers.</p>
        <h4>Legal basis</h4>
        <p>The legal basis for processing your personal data follows from the EU&ldquo;s Data Protection Regulation, Art. 6, paragraph 1, letters b, c and f, which state that a right to process personal data exists to fulfill contractual and legal requirements and when, after weighing up our interests, we have found that the described processing does not violate your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
        <h4>Disclosure and transfer of personal data</h4>
        <p>A distinction is made between disclosure and transfer of personal data to third parties. A release of personal data means that the data is communicated to a third party who subsequently has an independent right to process the personal data. A transfer of personal data means that the person to whom the personal data is communicated may only process it on behalf of the personal data controller and according to his instructions.</p>
        <p>Information about your name and e-mail address is disclosed to the company TrustPilot, among other things, so that they can send an invitation to review us on TrustPilot&ldquo;s website on our behalf. If you choose to fill in a review, TrustPilot acts as the personal data controller for the information you enter there.</p>
        <p>In some cases, we may disclose your personal data to other parties to comply with applicable law or in accordance with regulatory requirements or as part of an organizational restructuring, merger, takeover or sale.</p>
        <p>Personal data may be transferred to external partners, who process the data on our behalf. We collaborate with external partners in the work of, among other things, technical operation and improvements of our services, customer service, sending newsletters, satisfaction of our legal interests and targeted marketing, including retargeting and telemarketing and to give you the opportunity to review our company and our products.</p>
        <p>These external partners act as personal data assistants and act based on our instructions and process personal data for which we are the data controller. Personal data assistants may not use the data for purposes other than fulfilling the agreement they have concluded with us, and they are thus subject to a duty of confidentiality regarding the personal data. We have entered into written agreements on personal data processing with all personal data assistants who process personal data on our behalf.</p>
        <p>Several of these external data processors are based in the United States. The necessary guarantees for the transfer of personal data to the USA are ensured by the certification of each personal data processor according to the EU-US Privacy Shield, in accordance with the EU Data Protection Regulation Art. 45.</p>
