          <p>You can always see what content we plan to put in the boxes. However, we reserve the right to make any changes due to seasonal changes to ensure the best quality.</p>
          <h4>The deliveries</h4>
          <p>We deliver on Wednesdays between 08:00 and at 21.00.</p>
          <p>Delivery takes place to the address you specified on the order. In the event of incomplete address information, or in the event of address changes which mean that the driver cannot leave the delivery, we charge the full price.</p>
          <p>If you experience problems with your delivery, contact us directly via chat, e-mail <Link href="mailto:hej@fresh.land">hej@fresh.land</Link> or phone <Link href="tel:010-195 60 60">010-195 60 60</Link>.</p>
          <h4>Locked gate entrance</h4>
          <p>You are responsible for our drivers being able to enter your gate during the delivery time. If, for any of the reasons below, our drivers cannot enter your gate and thus do not deliver the delivery, we will charge the full price.</p>
          <p>If you live in an apartment with a locked entrance that is opened with a door code, you need to enter your door code. It is important that you keep us updated with the correct port code. In the case of incomplete port code information, which means that the driver cannot leave the delivery, we charge the full price. Email your port code to <Link href="mailto:hej@fresh.land">hej@fresh.land</Link> or log in and change your port code in your customer account.</p>
          <p>If you live in an apartment with a locked entrance door that is opened with an intercom that is connected to a mobile phone and can thus be opened remotely, you must be available on the mobile phone during the delivery time. If the driver cannot leave the delivery as a result of you not opening the gate, we will charge the full price.</p>
          <p>If you live in an apartment with a locked entrance that lacks both a door code and an intercom that can be opened remotely, you must be at home when delivery is made. You must be available and ready to open the gate during delivery time. If the driver cannot leave the delivery as a result of you not opening the gate, we will charge the full price.</p>
          <p>When ordering, you can indicate under comments where the box can be placed or left if you are not at home. In such a situation, we are not responsible for what happens to the box and its contents after delivery. Delivery is considered to have taken place when the box has been left at the designated location.</p>
          <h4>Quality guarantee</h4>
          <p>If an item does not meet our high quality standards, you have the right to complain about it. Then contact us via chat, e-mail, or phone <Link href="tel:010-195 60 60">010-195 60 60</Link> no later than 3 days after delivery, but preferably as soon as possible in connection with delivery.</p>
          <h4>Right of withdrawal (consumer purchases only)</h4>
          <p>There is no right of withdrawal for the purchase of food and other daily goods for a household, which are delivered to you or others as part of our regular distribution of goods.</p>
          <p>Right of withdrawal (consumer purchases only) does not apply for subscription-based purchases of food and other daily goods.</p>
